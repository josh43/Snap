A\+V\+Cam demonstrates how to use the A\+V\+Foundation capture A\+PI to record movies and capture still images. The sample has a record button for recording movies, a camera button for switching between front and back cameras (on supported devices), and a still button for capturing still images. A\+V\+Cam runs only on an actual device, either an i\+Pad or i\+Phone, and cannot be run in Simulator.
